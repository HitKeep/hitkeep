# HitKeep Helm Chart

This chart deploys the HitKeep single-binary service on Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes Guide

### Rationale

HitKeep follows the standard Helm pattern used by major charts: the chart emits a Service and (optionally) an Ingress, while the reverse proxy/ingress controller is provided by the cluster. This keeps the chart simple, avoids bundling a proxy, and fits most Kubernetes setups.

### Install (OCI via GHCR)

Use the [Kubernetes guide](https://hitkeep.com/guides/installation/kubernetes/) for commands matching the current published release.

Future chart publications use `oci://ghcr.io/hitkeep/charts/hitkeep`. Releases through `2.14.2` remain available from `oci://ghcr.io/pascalebeier/charts/hitkeep`.

### Minimal values

```
env:
  HITKEEP_PUBLIC_URL: "https://analytics.example.com"

extraEnv:
  - name: HITKEEP_JWT_SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: hitkeep-secrets
        key: jwt-secret
```

### Core configuration

- `domain`: convenience host for basic ingress (used when `ingress.hosts` is empty)
- `image.tag`: defaults to the chart app version, without a leading `v`
- `service.type`: `ClusterIP` (default), `LoadBalancer`, or `NodePort`
- `ingress.enabled`: creates an Ingress resource for your cluster's controller
- `ingress.className`: leave empty to use the cluster default
- `ingress.annotations`: controller-specific settings (cert-manager, auth, etc.)
- `customTrackingDomains.enabled`: configures HitKeep custom tracking domain runtime settings
- `customTrackingDomains.ingress.enabled`: creates a tracking-only Ingress for static custom tracker hosts
- `env.HITKEEP_PUBLIC_URL`: set to the browser-visible URL, including any path prefix
- `extraEnv`: use this for secret-backed values such as `HITKEEP_JWT_SECRET`
- `persistence.*`: PVC settings for `/var/lib/hitkeep/data`
- Probes: liveness uses `/healthz`; readiness uses `/readyz` and returns `503` with a stable reason while a shared or open tenant database is recovering or needs operator attention

By default, the chart stores the shared DuckDB database, tenant DuckDB databases, retention archives, QR Code graphic assets, and optional spam-list cache below the persistent mount:

- `HITKEEP_DB_PATH=/var/lib/hitkeep/data/hitkeep.db`
- `HITKEEP_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/hitkeep/data`
- `HITKEEP_ARCHIVE_PATH=/var/lib/hitkeep/data/archive`
- `HITKEEP_SPAM_FILTER_PATH=/var/lib/hitkeep/data/spam-filter.json`
- `HITKEEP_DB_RECOVERY_PATH=/var/lib/hitkeep/data/recovery` (derived from `HITKEEP_DATA_PATH` unless overridden)

Override those keys in `env` only when you also change the matching storage layout.

The recovery directory contains permission-restricted database/WAL bundles and resumable markers. It is intentionally persistent and is not pruned by `HITKEEP_BACKUP_RETENTION`; apply a separate access-control and retention policy.

### Scaling & clustering

Set `replicaCount` to 2+ to enable clustering. The chart uses a StatefulSet with stable pod names and configures gossip discovery via a headless service.

```
replicaCount: 3
```

When clustered, the chart sets `HITKEEP_BIND_ADDR` to the pod IP and joins via the headless service.

### Ingress (standard cluster setup)

```
domain: analytics.example.com

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "" # use cluster default
```

### Advanced Ingress (multiple hosts/paths)

```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - host: analytics.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
```

### LoadBalancer (no ingress controller)

```
service:
  type: LoadBalancer

ingress:
  enabled: false
```

### TLS with cert-manager (Let’s Encrypt)

This assumes cert-manager is installed and a ClusterIssuer exists.

```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - analytics.example.com
      secretName: hitkeep-tls
```

### Custom tracking domains

Custom tracking domains work in Kubernetes with the same HitKeep dashboard flow as other self-hosted installs. The chart does not install an ingress controller or Caddy. It configures the HitKeep pod and can emit a separate tracking-only Ingress for static hostnames managed by your cluster ingress controller.

Use external TLS mode when cert-manager, nginx ingress, Traefik, a cloud load balancer, or another certificate manager terminates TLS:

```
customTrackingDomains:
  enabled: true
  tlsMode: external
  # Empty defaults to the host from env.HITKEEP_PUBLIC_URL.
  # Set this when tracker domains point at a separate ingress hostname or IP.
  dnsTarget: ""
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    className: nginx
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    hosts:
      - host: tracker.customer-one.example
      - host: tracker.customer-two.example
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - tracker.customer-one.example
          - tracker.customer-two.example
        secretName: hitkeep-tracking-tls
```

The tracking Ingress only routes `/hk.js`, `/hk-vitals.js`, `/ingest`, `/ingest/event`, and `/ingest/web-vitals` to HitKeep. Other paths have no chart-generated rule, and HitKeep still returns `404` for dashboard/API routes on tracking hosts if a controller forwards them.

Use Caddy mode only when an external Caddy deployment handles on-demand TLS and calls HitKeep's ask endpoint:

```
customTrackingDomains:
  enabled: true
  tlsMode: caddy-on-demand
  caddyAskToken:
    existingSecret: hitkeep-caddy-ask
    existingSecretKey: token
```

For Caddy on-demand TLS, keep `customTrackingDomains.ingress.enabled=false` unless your Caddy ingress setup explicitly uses Kubernetes Ingress objects for those hostnames. Configure Caddy with `ask http://<hitkeep-service>/internal/caddy/on-demand-tls/<token>` and do not run Caddy on-demand TLS without the ask gate.

### Persistence

The chart mounts a PVC at `/var/lib/hitkeep/data` by default.

```
persistence:
  enabled: true
  size: 10Gi
  accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
```

### Optional MCP and AI configuration

HitKeep 2.15.0 can expose the read-only MCP endpoint, optional AI-backed Opportunity features, and the optional Ask AI dashboard assistant when you configure them explicitly. <!-- x-release-please-version -->

```
env:
  HITKEEP_MCP_ENABLED: "true"
  HITKEEP_MCP_PATH: "/mcp"
  HITKEEP_MCP_MAX_RANGE_DAYS: "366"
  HITKEEP_AI_ENABLED: "true"
  HITKEEP_ASK_AI_ENABLED: "true"
  HITKEEP_AI_PROVIDER: "openai-compatible"
  HITKEEP_AI_MODEL: "gpt-4.1-mini"

extraEnv:
  - name: HITKEEP_AI_API_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: hitkeep-ai
        key: api-key
```

### Optional backups and spam-list refresh

Local backups are disabled until `HITKEEP_BACKUP_PATH` is set. Keep local backup output on persistent storage or use an `s3://` destination with the S3 environment variables.

```
env:
  HITKEEP_BACKUP_PATH: "/var/lib/hitkeep/data/backups"
  HITKEEP_BACKUP_INTERVAL: "60"
  HITKEEP_BACKUP_RETENTION: "24"
  HITKEEP_SPAM_FILTER_AUTO_UPDATE: "true"
  HITKEEP_SPAM_FILTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL: "1440"
```
